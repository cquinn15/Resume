About

I am currently a product owner of an end-to-end, proprietary software solution for Builders Capital, focusing on bridging the gap between technology and business needs. Iâ€™m passionate about building a product that is not only functional but enjoyable to use, and believe that thoughtful, well-designed software is key to meeting business requirements and winning loyal customers.

 > I am currently an agile Product Owner of the front-end to the end-to-end solution of proprietary loan servicing software. As the Product Owner, I am building user testing initiatives in order to better understand the problems our users face and solve for those problems efficiently while also meeting business requirements. In addition, I draft wireframes and mockups along with writing the requirements for new software features while managing the product backlog. Frequently, I act as the first line of defense for troubleshooting questions for both employees and customers and assist team members when needed in a live production environment.

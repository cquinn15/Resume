About

I am currently a product owner of an end-to-end, proprietary software solution for Builders Capital, focusing on bridging the gap between technology and business needs. Iâ€™m passionate about building a product that is not only functional but enjoyable to use, and believe that thoughtful, well-designed software is key to meeting business requirements and winning loyal customers.

- Business Analyst at **Builders Capital** July 2018-Present

 > Product Owner
- User Testing

  - I introduced User Testing as part of our workflow this year. Stakeholders and employees have commented on the improvement in our product usabilty, we have seen less frustration and confusion with new releases and employees who are brought in to help with User Testing feel a vested interest in our Product. Initially seen as an unneeded step that would slow down the development process, it is now a piece that is requested by Stakeholders due to the value it brings to our product. 
- Documenting Business Requirements
- Quality Assurane Testing
- Wireframes and mockups along with writing the requirements for new software features while managing the product backlog. Frequently, I act as the first line of defense for troubleshooting questions for both employees and customers and assist team members when needed in a live production environment.
